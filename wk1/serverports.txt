Web server ports are the logical endpoints of a network connection that is used to exchange information between a web server and a web client.

    Port numbers 0 to 1024 are reserved for privileged services and designated as well-known ports. In TCP/IP and UDP networks, a port is an endpoint to a logical connection and the way a client program specifies a specific server program on a computer in a network. The port number identifies what type of port it is.

A port number is a 16-bit unsigned integer, thus ranging from 0 to 65535.
